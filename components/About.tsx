            What about me. My name is Federico Kratter Thaler. Yes, the surname
            is Austrian, no, I can`t speak Austrian. IÂ´m 24 and I am from Milan,
            Italy. Since high school I have developed a particular passion for
            photography, which subsequently led me to approach the world of art
            and design, starting my studies at Politecnico di Milano.

            During these three years, in addition to investigating the themes of
            space and living, I have also explored the themes of user
            experience, interaction and communication design during my first
            working experiences as a freelancer. Thanks to these experiences I
            realized that these were the areas I wanted to focus on.

            Interface Designer, as well as User Experience & Interaction
            Designer. The clients I worked with included Juventus, UnipolSai,
