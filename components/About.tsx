            What about me. My name is Federico Kratter Thaler, IÂ´m 24 and I am
            from Milan, Italy. Since high school I have developed a particular
            passion for photography, which subsequently led me to approach the
            world of art and design, starting my studies at Politecnico di
            Milano.

            During these three years, in addition to investigating the themes of
            space and living, I have also explored the themes of user
            experience, interaction and communication design during my first
            working experiences as a freelancer. Thanks to these experiences I
            realized that these were the areas I wanted to focus on.

            My first work experience was in Value Partners, a consultancy firm
            in Milan. I participated in various projects in the role of User
            Interface Designer, as well as User Experience & Interaction
            Designer. The clients I worked with included Juventus, UnipolSai,
            Zegna, Crif, Edison and OneofUs.
