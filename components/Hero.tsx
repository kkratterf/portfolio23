          Hi, there. I am Federico, a digital product designer focus on user
          experience, user interface and interaction. Im love also frontend
          development and photography. I have been creating digital design over
          past 3 years. My work spans across brandings to digital UI/UX, as well
          as creative & art directions, graphics, websites for brand
          communications in Milano, and interactions for high profile movies in
          Los Angeles. I build experiences from screens, mobiles to physical
          spaces. No matter the mediums, I have been always blurring the line
          between design and technology, and keep pushing the boundaries of
          whatâ€™s ahead.
